# Lessons

Dated, one lesson per entry. Written when something was got wrong, or when a
correction arrived. Reviewed at session start.

Two rules for this file, inherited from the previous project because they are
what made it useful rather than decorative:

- **Write the pattern, not the incident.** "PR #42 broke staging" ages out;
  "unreadable must never resolve to zero" doesn't.
- **A lesson earns its place by preventing a repeat.** If it would not have
  changed what someone did, it is a note, not a lesson.

A third rule, added 2026-08-17 for the reason the first lesson below records:

- **This file is an index plus the newest entries; the lessons themselves live
  in `tasks/archive/lessons-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.** Nothing has been distilled,
  reworded or dropped — the archive reconstructs the pre-split file byte for
  byte. Write new lessons here, at the top, and move them into the dated
  archive file when this one approaches the size budget.
- **The size budget is 262,144 bytes**, enforced by
  `tests/test_session_files_are_readable.py`. It is the point at which the Read
  tool refuses the file outright, which is how "read this at session start"
  became an instruction no session could obey.

---

## 2026-08-17 — A document that has outgrown its reader is unread, and it reads as compliance

`CLAUDE.md` opens by telling every session to read `tasks/todo.md` and
`tasks/lessons.md` at session start; `AGENTS.md` repeats it and adds
`tasks/NEXT.md`, claiming to do so "exactly as `CLAUDE.md` says". Measured this
morning, before anything was moved:

```
tasks/NEXT.md      456,641 bytes   8,145 lines
tasks/lessons.md   426,584 bytes   7,592 lines
Read tool ceiling  262,144 bytes
```

Both files were **past the point where the tool returns any content at all** —
not truncated, refused. The instruction had been impossible to obey for some
time, and no session reported that. Sessions coped by opening the head, which
produces exactly the behaviour of a session that read the file, and the two are
indistinguishable from outside.

**The second half of the shape: the instruction and its restatement had already
drifted apart**, and the drift pointed at the larger file. `CLAUDE.md` names two
files; `AGENTS.md` names three and says it is quoting. Neither statement was
checked against the sizes it was demanding, because a reading instruction is the
kind of sentence that is audited for *content* and never for *feasibility*.

**The pattern is this repo's own named defect, one level up.** `tasks/lessons.md`
carries *"code with no caller is not a feature, it is a plan"*, and
`tests/test_has_callers.py` exists to enforce it on `backend/`. A lesson nobody
can open is a lesson with no caller. The file's own second rule — *a lesson
earns its place by preventing a repeat* — had quietly stopped applying to most
of its own contents, because prevention requires being read, and 179 lessons
behind a refused read prevent nothing.

**The mechanism is append-only growth against a budget nobody owned.** Every
session had a local incentive to add and none to prune, and each addition was
individually correct. There is no line number for the defect; it is the sum. At
~875KB the two session-start files were **~219,000 tokens** against a 300–500K
session budget — the memory would have consumed most of the budget it exists to
protect, on the first tool call.

**How to apply.**

- **A document written for a stated reader has a size budget, and the budget is
  the reader's, not the writer's.** Before adding to a file that something is
  instructed to read, check what it costs that reader to read it. `wc -c` is one
  command, and the answer here had been decisive for days.
- **Where the reader is a tool with a hard limit, put a test on the limit — not
  a note in the prose.** A guard fires on the commit that crosses the line; a
  convention written at the top of a file is read by whoever is already reading
  the file, which is the population that does not need it.
- **Split, never distil.** Fitting a history under a limit by summarising it
  trades an unbounded loss — the one lesson that turns out to matter — against a
  bounded inconvenience, an extra file open. The archive keeps every byte and
  the top-level file keeps an index; the recovery cost is one `Read` on a dated
  file, and the index says which one.
- **An index of patterns is not a summary of them.** One line per lesson,
  phrased as the claim, is enough for a reader to know whether to open the
  entry. That is a *routing* artefact, and it is the only compression that does
  not destroy the thing being compressed.

**What this does not establish.** Nothing here says the lessons are good, or
that anyone acted on the ones they could read. It establishes one thing: a
session-start instruction that names a file larger than the reader's limit is
not an instruction, and it will not announce itself.

# The pattern index

Every lesson ever written, newest date first, one line each. The full text of
each is in the linked archive file, unchanged.

### 2026-08-17 — in this file, above

- A document that has outgrown its reader is unread, and it reads as compliance

### 2026-08-17 — [`archive/lessons-2026-08-17.md`](archive/lessons-2026-08-17.md)

- A ceiling is not a spend
- `.env.example` is a contract, not a configuration
- A collective noun is not a measurement
- An exclusion count describes the filter, not the world

### 2026-08-16 — [`archive/lessons-2026-08-16.md`](archive/lessons-2026-08-16.md)

- "X requires Y" is a necessary condition, and meeting it does not elect X
- A stopping rule may only be amended in the file that registered it
- A negative claim inherits its instrument's WHERE clause
- A diagnostic reachable only through the healthy path cannot diagnose the unhealthy one
- Docker builds from the working tree, so a byte-level write bypasses .gitattributes
- An absent environment variable means the default applies, not that the feature is off
- An alias between two constants is a bet that they answer the same question
- Two identifiers that are equal by construction render as a bug
- A defect written down beside a guard is not written down in it
- A probe's request parameters are part of its finding, and they do not travel with the sentence
- A ratio against a control assumes the control is one number
- "Unreadable" and "empty" are different, and the wire decides which one you get
- A new caller that makes an existing call is indistinguishable from the existing caller
- SQLite rewrites your CREATE TABLE text, so a comment above the last column can break the table
- A default is not the behaviour, because the caller may override it — and relaying to Joe is publication
- A count that exactly equals a natural subpopulation is a bug in the counter, not a finding about the data
- Calling a registered precondition "just a diagnostic" is how the precondition gets skipped
- An agreement forced by the writer looks exactly like a clean measurement

### 2026-08-15 — [`archive/lessons-2026-08-15.md`](archive/lessons-2026-08-15.md)

- A guard copied from a neighbouring path inherits its *assumptions*, not its safety
- A cost estimated from an assumed input is not an estimate, it is the assumption restated
- A test's *invented* example can turn out to be real, and it fails on the axis it was never about
- A mutation refuted a code comment, and the comment was the thing that had to change

### 2026-08-14 — [`archive/lessons-2026-08-14.md`](archive/lessons-2026-08-14.md)

- A cleanup that did not run is invisible; the next run then canonises the damage
- The money rule is `Decimal`; an *analysis* that reconciles money in floats invents findings

### 2026-08-13 — [`archive/lessons-2026-08-13.md`](archive/lessons-2026-08-13.md)

- A derived guard covers exactly the class it derives from, and the class it cannot see looks identical from outside

### 2026-08-11 — [`archive/lessons-2026-08-11.md`](archive/lessons-2026-08-11.md)

- Mutation testing belongs in its own worktree, not in the shared one
- Scoping `git add` leaves `git commit` binding, and the symptom is unchanged
- Evidence a decision already cites is not grounds to re-open it
- An instrument whose every branch points one way is uninformative, and that is a reason to re-price it, not to cancel it
- A count written into a handoff cannot include its own commit
- A test that constructs the parameter it is checking cannot detect that no caller constructs it
- A default on a guard input is a decision about what happens when nobody knows, and on a limit it is always the permissive one
- A readout verified on the demo instance can be structurally blind on the live one
- An observability fix that stops at the API boundary has not been made
- A demo that renders healthy beside a live instance that renders empty is an argument machine for the wrong conclusion
- The file-ownership map between parallel lanes is a design artefact, and getting it wrong is the director's error
- A verdict the instrument cannot emit was written into two handoffs as a result
- The exclusion outranks the copy, and it is the copy that gets cited
- A mutation that cannot change behaviour is a green light you awarded yourself
- Two rows that name the same outcome are not a pair, and pairing them halves nothing
- A lower bound rejects correctly; it is the acceptances that are unproven
- Two artefacts that agree on the number you check are how a pin swap goes unnoticed
- A registered decision rule can be logically defective, and pre-registration is exactly what stops you noticing
- The anchor where the error vanishes keeps getting chosen, and it looks like the natural place to measure
- Fixing how a wrong row is drawn leaves the query that chose it
- A "decisions already made" list is a cache with no invalidation
- Deployment cannot be inferred from commit times in this repo
- A repeated row is not an independent observation, and the denominator that flatters a claim is usually the row count

### 2026-08-10 — [`archive/lessons-2026-08-10.md`](archive/lessons-2026-08-10.md)

- An empty endpoint is not an empty account

- A permission grant is not the guarantee it is described as
- The cheapest fix for a mutation is a mutation already scheduled
- A control that swaps the data source still shares the estimator
- Read the coverage line, not the slot list
- Consecutive date buckets tile, and overlap is the safe direction
- A command in a handoff has the status of a test never seen red
- A fixed-sample threshold quoted for a design that peeks inflates its own power about threefold
- A measurement with no committed artifact is a rumour, and a handoff can promote it to a verdict in one line
- A subagent's confident negative is the one result you must re-run yourself
- "Routed separately" names no owner, and the wrong sentence stays where people read it
- An amended registration's body is not the registration, and the superseded sentence is the one that reads best
- The power of an instrument is not the power of the question, and the gap is invisible from inside the arithmetic
- The rule about other agents' confident negatives applies to your own, and you will not notice

### 2026-08-09 — [`archive/lessons-2026-08-09.md`](archive/lessons-2026-08-09.md)

- Two clocks that never overlap, so the test cannot be run
- A risk control can be a threshold on the wrong quantity entirely
- A measurement can be switched off by a number that is not about measurement
- An enumeration is not a proof, and "every" is the word to distrust
- A schema comment is code that nothing executes
- A guard standing behind a stricter guard is decoration
- A once-only WRITE behind an unbounded READ is not once-only
- A break that is equivalent to the original proves nothing
- "It probably fits in one page" is a fact you can just measure
- A sample whose strata do not overlap the target proves nothing, at any `n`
- A term that is zero everywhere has an unobservable sign
- A defence built for one axis of a classifier is not a defence for the classifier
- Arithmetic that reproduces to the digit says nothing about its inputs
- "Read-only" is not a scope boundary; name the environment
- The census must apply the same filter the storage path applies

- An enumeration of the safe cases is a list you will forget to extend
- The value you already had is not a value you chose
- A guard tightened for a false negative fires on the file explaining it
- `occurrence_datetime` is a shifted start, and both stories had real evidence
- A green suite that depended on what time you ran it
- A component that only exists after a tap is invisible to every check you have
- One environment variable, two readers, two different times
- Sync code that is only ever called from a coroutine
- A secret in `.env` makes the test suite behave differently per machine
- The schema file runs against databases that already exist

- Recovering structure by parsing free text, in a boot path

### 2026-08-07 — [`archive/lessons-2026-08-07.md`](archive/lessons-2026-08-07.md)

- Every per-cell guard can pass and the conclusion still be wrong

- Suppressing a conclusion is not suppressing the finding
- A budget that says *whether* and never *when*
- A stored age rendered as a current one
- Two populations in one record, told apart by dispersion

### 2026-08-06 — [`archive/lessons-2026-08-06.md`](archive/lessons-2026-08-06.md)

- Unreadable must never resolve to zero
- Clamping is for values you trust
- A test that passes on the bug is not a test
